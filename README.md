# logFactory for farmOS

This sandbox is for testing the logFactory used in the farmOS native 
and client libraries. It can be viewed here:
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jgaehring/farmos-logfactory

You can run some tests in the console from `src/index.js`, or run the 
example log statements already contained there.

To see what's happening internally, checkout `src/logFactory.js`. 
The main function export in there is essentially the same one that's
contained in the farmos-native repository, though it may be outdated 
depending on when you're reading this and how frequently I've managed 
to update this sandbox.

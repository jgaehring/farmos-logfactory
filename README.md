# logFactory for farmOS

This sandbox is for testing the logFactory used in the farmOS native 
and client libraries. It can be viewed here:
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jgaehring/farmos-logfactory

You can run some tests in the console from `index.js`, or run the 
example log statements already contained there.

The main function export in `logFactory.js` is essentially the same 
contained in the farmos-native repository, though it may be outdated 
depending on when you're reading this and how frequently I've managed 
to update this sandbox.
